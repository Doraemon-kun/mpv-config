### MPV Main Configuration files - Written by AM, on Sep 03 2023
### Disclaimer: This is my configuration for my own system for my own use. Don't copy it, read it and modify it as you feel need.
### Current system: Intel Core i5-10400 (Intel UHD Graphics 630); No discrete GPU; RAM 8GB; Microsoft Windows 11
### OSC in use: ModernX

# Video Rendering
profile=gpu-hq	# Use "mpv --show-profile=gpu-hq" to look at the options applied and mpv documentation for more information
vo=gpu-next		# Video output driver, using gpu-next: gpu but with libplacebo, faster and higher quality, with more bugs. Failsafe to gpu
gpu-api=d3d11	# Force DirectX3D by default. OpenGL dropping frames. Vulkan doesn't work well with Intel GPU as of 2023
#gpu-shader-cache-dir=~~/.cache	# Shader cache directory. Unset so Windows can handle it automatically
hwdec=d3d11va	# Hardware decoder to use. Opt for D3D11VA due to it being native on Windows, and I don't have the prestigious opportunities to use Vulkan or NVdec
video-sync=display-resample	# Video/audio syncing to match display refresh rate. Required for interpolation, increase A/V mismatch when switching windows.
interpolation=yes

# MPV Behavior
autofit-larger=90%
osc=no	# OSC lua script is already enabled, no need for the default
osd-bar=no	# Hide volume control bar when changing volume and progress control bar when seeking
border=no	# OSC have support for window control, so no need for the border (Disable Windows default border control, which includes hiding the three top-left buttons)
cursor-autohide=500	# Self-explanatory
keep-open=yes	# Keep mpv open at the end of video
force-window=yes	# Force to have a window, good when playing audio files from terminal
reset-on-next-file=profile,speed,volume,sub	# Reset these things if changed during playback (after file close)
keepaspect=yes	# Self-explanatory
force-seekable=yes	# Self-explanatory
msg-module=yes	# More debugging thing

# Streaming Behaviour
hls-bitrate=max	# Max bitrate on HLS stream
ytdl-format=bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best	# For ytdlp, look for video with max resolution and doesn't exceed 1080px in height and best audio quality. Otherwise, best coupler.
sub-auto=fuzzy
ytdl-raw-options=ignore-config=,sub-langs="en.*",write-auto-sub=,write-sub=

# Audio Behaviour
audio-file-auto=fuzzy	# Autoload additional media from files with same filename as video in the same directory
audio-pitch-correction=yes	# Use to correct pitch in high-speed situation

# Scaler: My system can handle these perfectly fine (I haven't had any issues with it). If your system doesn't have a decent power to scale things with filters, then get rid of these (spline36 afterthat)
scale=ewa_lanczos
scale-blur=0.981251

# Debanding
deband=no	# Disable debanding by default
deband-iterations=3	# Number of deband step per sample
deband-threshold=40	# The power of the deband

# Shader
glsl-shaders="~~/shaders/nnedi3-nns128-win8x4.hook"	# GLSL shader. Read mpv for more.
